Once upon a time, there was a girl called Monika. She lived in a quiet town where everyone knew each other. Monika was known for her intelligence and kindness, but there was something mysterious about her. Every evening, she would sit by the old oak tree in the town square, writing in her notebook. No one knew what she wrote, but rumors spread that she was working on something extraordinary.

One day, a curious boy named Alex approached her. "What are you writing?" he asked. Monika smiled and replied, "I'm writing our story—yours, mine, and everyone's." Alex was puzzled but intrigued. Over time, he noticed that whatever Monika wrote seemed to come true. If she wrote about rain, the sky darkened. If she wrote about laughter, joy filled the town.

But one evening, Monika looked troubled. "What’s wrong?" Alex asked. She hesitated and whispered, "I wrote something... something I can't erase." That night, the town changed forever.
