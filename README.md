This example project currently support Windows, Linux and MacOS. Please follow the corresponding guidance for your environment.

### 1 For Windows

#### 1.1 Clone the Repository

First, please clone the project to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/GorgonMeducer/NotGenshinClock.git
```

The `--recursive` option is used to clone all the submodules included in the project.

#### 1.2 Install GCC (mingw32) and Make

Second, please 

- download and install GCC. You **MUST** download the [latest mingw32](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases/). For example, [i686-13.1.0-release-posix-dwarf-ucrt-rt_v11-rev1.7z](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases/download/13.1.0-rt_v11-rev1/i686-13.1.0-release-posix-dwarf-ucrt-rt_v11-rev1.7z) Unzip the package and copy it to your desired location. 
- [download](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) and install Make.

**NOTE**: Ensure you have correctly set the **PATH** variable in the Windows environment for GCC and Make. After installation, you may need to restart your computer to ensure the new environment variable settings take effect.

Finally, please open the project in VS Code. You can do this by choosing "**Open Workspace from File**"  in the File menu in VS Code and then selecting the workspace file `NotGenshinClock.code-workspace` in the `NotGenshinClock` folder that you have just cloned.

In "**Run and Debug**" panel, you can run the project via "**build and run x86(32)**" or you can press "**F5**" to launch a debug session.
